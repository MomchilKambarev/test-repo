//Write a program which advices the user where to go to a vacation based on the type of the vacation and the
//budget. There should be two options â€“ Beach, Mountain. If the user put a different value then the program
//should print a message that there is no information about this type of vacation. Budgets are considered per
//day per person. If the budget per day for Beach type vacation is smaller than 50 then the program should
//advise Bulgaria as a destination, otherwise Outside Bulgaria. If the budget per day for Mountain type vacation
//is smaller than 30 then the program should advise Bulgaria as a destination, otherwise Outside Bulgaria.
